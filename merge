# This python script merges the deposit_X.csv files and save into a sorted file.
# It reads one line from each deposit file into a buffer, compares them, and
# pops and saves the smallest one into the sorted file. It then refills the
# buffer by reading a new line from the corresponding deposit file. If one deposit
# file is finished, it is closed and removed from the buffer.

# There are 9 deposit_X.csv files, where X = 1..9.
# Each line represents one data point, and consists of multiple integers.
# The 4th and 5th integers are the sorting keys.
